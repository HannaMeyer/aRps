Description: aRpsonde is a collection of programs for reading and
        plotting SKEW-T,log p diagrams and wind profiles for data
        collected by radiosondes (the typical weather balloon-borne
        instrument), which we will call "flights", "sondes", or
        "profiles" throughout the associated documentation.  The raw
        data files are in a common format that has a header followed by
        specific variables.  Use "help(ExampleSonde)" for the full
        explanation of the data files.
        The visualisation of sounding data is cloned by the package Radisonde 
        originally from Tim Hoar, Eric Gilleland,  Doug Nychka and Liangying Zhang
        <thoar@ucar.edu> This was adapted to provide degree Celsius scaling 
        and the possibility to focus on the lower boundary pressure levels
        with respect to ARPS model run results
        The visualisation of the meteogram plots utilize Code from the package 
        meteogRam as provided by Bogdan Bochenek <bogdan.bochenek@uj.edu.pl>
