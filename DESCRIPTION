Description: 
Description: aRpsonde is a collection of programs for reading and
        plotting SKEW-T,log p diagrams and wind profiles for data
        collected by radiosondes (the typical weather balloon-borne
        instrument), which we will call "flights", "sondes", or
        "profiles" throughout the associated documentation.  The raw
        data files are in a common format that has a header followed by
        specific variables.  Use "help(ExampleSonde)" for the full
        explanation of the data files.
        It ist a clone of the package Radisonde to analyze and visualite 
        ARPS model run results with degree Celsius on the temperature axis
        as well as the possiblity to zoom in th eboundary layer pressure levels
