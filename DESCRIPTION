Description: aRps is a collection of routines for georeference, read and
    plot ARPS model run results.
    Currently the following plots are supported:
    meteograms with n parametes, different SKEW-T,log p diagrams (C)
    wind profiles for vertical and temporal meteorological data as derived by
    rawinsondes or in this case numerical weather prediction models as ARPS
    The raw ARPS raw data files are in netCDF format. Data is converted and some thermodynamic 
    calculations are performed. Finally it the netCDF file is correctly georeferenced.  
    Use "help(ExampleSonde)" for the full explanation of the sounding data files.
    The visualisation of sounding data is cloned by the package Radiosonde
    originally from Tim Hoar, Eric Gilleland, Doug Nychka and Liangying Zhang
    <thoar@ucar.edu>. The adaption provides degree Celsius, and the option to focus 
    on the lower boundary pressure levels using also ARPS model run results.
    The visualisation of the meteogram plots utilize Code from the package
    meteogRam as provided by Bogdan Bochenek <bogdan.bochenek@uj.edu.pl>
