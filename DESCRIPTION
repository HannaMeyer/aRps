Description: aRps is a collection of routines for georeference, read and
    plot ARPS model run results.
    Currently the following plots are supported:
    meteograms with n parametes, different SKEW-T,log p diagrams (C)
    wind profiles for vertical and temporal meteorological data as derived by
    rawinsondes or in this case numerical weather prediction models as ARPS
    The raw ARPS raw data files are in netCSF format. This is extracted and
    transformed  format to a matrix with a header followed by
    specific variables.  Use "help(ExampleSonde)" for the full
    explanation of the sounding data files.
    The visualisation of sounding data is cloned by the package Radisonde
    originally from Tim Hoar, Eric Gilleland,  Doug Nychka and Liangying Zhang
    <thoar@ucar.edu> This was adapted to provide degree Celsius scaling
    and the possibility to focus on the lower boundary pressure levels
    with respect to ARPS model run results
    The visualisation of the meteogram plots utilize Code from the package
    meteogRam as provided by Bogdan Bochenek <bogdan.bochenek@uj.edu.pl>
